    <h3>2023.10.04, Wednesday</h3>
    <p>Completed the CSS intro material and updated my <a href="https://mandi628.github.io/odin-recipes">recipes repo</a>. I would like to organize the practice pages a little better, but I'm not sure the best way. Probably just moving them to another folder. (DONE)</p>

    <h3>2023.10.03, Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Made a lot of progress today. Figured out how to get VSCode working the way I expect it to.
        Also started working with Git. Finally got to an assignment using it. I understand a lot more
        now than I did before. Excited for my first project actually making something.</p>

    <!-- Not really sure where to put this, but this will come in handy. VSCode shortcut for html file documents is "!" on the first line. -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Fugit ducimus ipsum officiis iusto hic cupiditate deleniti velit tenetur molestias quibusdam, harum sint mollitia iure ad nemo odit nobis. Excepturi, totam?</p>
    <!-- "lorem" + Enter will add dummy text (VSCode shortcut) -->
    <p>I'm supposed to practice using the <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> tags in some dummy text. I'm also supposed to practice using the heading tags, but I've already done that, without even knowing I was going to. <strong>I had forgotten about "strong" replacing the old "bold" tags.</strong> <em>I also had forgotten about the "em" tag replacing the "italics" tag.</em></p>
    <p>Covered basic HTML today. Nothing I didn't already know, although the best practices were helpful. Excited to get to more. I already learned a lot. Now I just have to figure out how to get a step further.</p>
    <h3>How to write a meaningful commit message</h3>
    <p>It's probably a good idea to start practicing this now, so I need to figure out how to have git tracking this website I'm making. In the meantime, these are the 7 rules for making good commit messages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start the commit message with a single short (<50 characters) summary of the change, followed by a blank line, then a more thorough description.</li>
        <li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters.</li>
        <li>Capitalize the subject line.</li>
        <li>Don't end the subject line with a period. Think of it like a news headline.</li>
        <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line; like giving a verbal command. A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence: "If applied, this commit will _____."</li>
        <li>Wrap the body at 72 characters.</li>
        <li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Completed the Recipe Website Project in the Fundamentals Course.</p>
    <p>Continued into CSS portion of curriculum. Need to stop, though. Been at it about 8 hours today. Just couldn't stop!</p>
