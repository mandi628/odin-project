    <h3>2024.02.05, Monday</h3>
    <p>I got distracted for awhile. Tried to focus on another career path and it hasn't panned out. Continuing my progress on The Odin Project - <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-3">Fundamentals Part 3</a>.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, I did set up a Git-hosted TiddlyWiki for <a href = "https://mandi628.github.io/family-recipes">our family recipes</a>, and <a href = "https://mandi628.github.io/my-bullet-journal">a bullet journal</a>.</p>

    <h3>2023.10.14, Saturday</h3>
    <p>It was not in my plan today, but I ended up creating a website for myself for my craft projects. I'm actually pretty pleased with it. UPDATE: 2024.02.05 Not sure what I was talking about here or where I hosted it. Ummm...</p>

    <h3>2023.10.13, Friday</h3>
    <p>Working on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-2">JS Fundamentals Part 2</a> today.</p>
    <p>I completed the lesson, but am a little frustrated. The coding, so far, is pretty self-explanatory. But it's a matter of knowing what you want the code to do, and that's where I'm lost. I will continue, because the lessons are helpful and producing results. But I'm still frustrated. Did the assignment on <a href="https://www.replit.com">replit.com</a>. Not really sure of the usage of that site, but I'm sure I'll find out.</p>
    <p>I have other things to do today, but I might work on the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lesson/foundations-javascript-developer-tools">next lesson</a> today, since it covers the Chrome Developer Tools, and I've already covered some of it in the CSS lessons. It seens like an easy lesson, compared to the one I just completed.</p>

    <h3>2023.10.12, Thursday</h3>
    <p>Tuesday was a busy day, but I did start the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-1">Fundamentals Part 1</a> of the JavaScript Module on The Odin Project. I didn't get very far because it was late in the day.</p>
    <p>I'm making more progress with it today, and I had some inspiration last night, so I'm going to try a few things before I wrap it up for today. Here are <a href="javascript.html">my notes</a> regarding JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Completed Fundamentals Part 1, and looking forward to <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-2">Part 2</a>, but I really should do some other things today.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>2023.10.09, Monday</h3>
    <p>Forgot to mention yesterday that I spent a good part of the day in front of the screen trying to set up the <a href="https://www.todotxt.org">todo.txt</a> system. The script itself isn't difficult, but getting the configuration set up properly to my GoogleDrive so that I could access it from other devices was tricky. I thought I had it, then it didn't work. So I thought I had it again. Turned out my issue was in how I had entered the pathname for the files. It is correct now and working well.</p>
    <p>Finishing the Flexbox exercises today, and hopefully starting on the final Flexbox project - <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page">The Landing Page</a>. I want to apply the flexbox material to this and my recipes website before I forget it, so I'll be ready to start the JavaScript Basics module tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Completed the <a href="https://mandi628.github.io/landing-page-project/">Landing Page Project</a>, and ready for the JavaScript module. I should check my work againse the solutions, but I will do that later. My brain is kind of fried, and I'm feeling a little self-conscious about my work. But I was able to get all the elements in the right places, and it got easier as I went.</p>

    <h3>2023.10.08, Sunday</h3>
    <p>Took a break from the screen yesterday. Today, I am redoing the exercises from the Alignment section. I still need flexbox practice, but I'm getting the hang of it. I still seem to want to automatically put everything in a div, and that's not really necessary. Once I'm done with these assignments, I will apply the flexboxes to my pages here and see if I can make them better.</p>
    <p>Got through the first five but life interrupted in the middle of exercise #6. The Flexboxes are tripping me up, but I think I will get it with enough practice. I should go through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a> web design projects before proceeding with JavaScript. But I think they will go faster because these lessons have taught me a lot of the "whys" of the code, instead of just copying and pasting it from the instructions.</p>

    <h3>2023.10.06, Friday</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-flexbox">Foundations Course: Introduction to FlexBox</a> - played with flexboxes in my nav menu. Great tutorial on the use of flexboxes.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-growing-and-shrinking">Foundations Course: Growing and Shrinking</a> - discusses the values of <code>flex</code>, indicated <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-axes">Foundations Course: Axes</a> - discusses the use of <code>flex-direction</code> to diplay flex content in rows vs. columns. Flex containers work in rows by default, but you can determine they work in columns, as well. When you change the direction to columns, instead of rows, the axes change. <code>align-items</code>, which works for adjusting vertical alignment with rows, adjust hortizontal alignment when set to columns. And <code>justify-content</code>, which normally works for side-to-side alignemnt in rows, adjusts vertical alignment in columns.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-alignment">Foundations Course: Alignment</a> - explains proper use of <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>. This lesson has lots of technical detail about managing flexboxes. I feel a little overwhelmed, but excited to try them. Need to practice more before I move on, I think.</p>

    <h3>2023.10.05, Thursday</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-block-and-inline">Foundations Course: Block and Inline</a> - read material and watched tutorials. Learned that I did my navigation wrong for this group of pages. Correcting now. Added <a href="../practice/boxmodel.html">Box Model</a> page to demonstrate the concept.</p>
    <p>Margins are great for positioning items on a page. If only one value is given, the command assumes application on all four sides: <code>margin: 1.5em</code>. If defining margins individually, you can use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>margin: top right bottom left</code>, or</li>
        <li><code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>, <code>margin-bottom</code>, or <code>margin-left</code></li>
        <li>A value of <code>auto</code> can also be used, but a set width of the element is required. This is only useful for horizontal centering.</li>
        <li>Vertical margins will overlap, or collapse, and have a total value of the larger of the two set values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learned about <code>display: inline;</code> vs. <code>display: block;</code> vs. <code>display: inline-block;</code>. Updated <a href="https://mandi628.github.io/odin-recipes">Recipes Project</a>, as per assignment.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>2023.10.04, Wednesday</h3>
    <p>Completed the CSS intro material and updated my <a href="https://mandi628.github.io/odin-recipes">recipes repo</a>. I would like to organize the practice pages a little better, but I'm not sure the best way. Probably just moving them to another folder. (DONE)</p>

    <h3>2023.10.03, Tuesday</h3>
    <p>Made a lot of progress today. Figured out how to get VSCode working the way I expect it to.
        Also started working with Git. Finally got to an assignment using it. I understand a lot more
        now than I did before. Excited for my first project actually making something.</p>
    </p>
    <!-- Not really sure where to put this, but this will come in handy. VSCode shortcut for html file documents is "!" on the first line. -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Fugit ducimus ipsum officiis iusto hic cupiditate deleniti velit tenetur molestias quibusdam, harum sint mollitia iure ad nemo odit nobis. Excepturi, totam?</p>
    <!-- "lorem" + Enter will add dummy text (VSCode shortcut) -->
    <p>I'm supposed to practice using the <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasis</em> tags in some dummy text. I'm also supposed to practice using the heading tags, but I've already done that, without even knowing I was going to. <strong>I had forgotten about "strong" replacing the old "bold" tags.</strong> <em>I also had forgotten about the "em" tag replacing the "italics" tag.</em></p>
    <p>Covered basic HTML today. Nothing I didn't already know, although the best practices were helpful. Excited to get to more. I already learned a lot. Now I just have to figure out how to get a step further.</p>
    <h3>How to write a meaningful commit message</h3>
    <p>It's probably a good idea to start practicing this now, so I need to figure out how to have git tracking this website I'm making. In the meantime, these are the 7 rules for making good commit messages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start the commit message with a single short (<50 characters) summary of the change, followed by a blank line, then a more thorough description.</li>
        <li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters.</li>
        <li>Capitalize the subject line.</li>
        <li>Don't end the subject line with a period. Think of it like a news headline.</li>
        <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line; like giving a verbal command. A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence: "If applied, this commit will _____."</li>
        <li>Wrap the body at 72 characters.</li>
        <li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Completed the Recipe Website Project in the Fundamentals Course.</p>
    <p>Continued into CSS portion of curriculum. Need to stop, though. Been at it about 8 hours today. Just couldn't stop!</p>
